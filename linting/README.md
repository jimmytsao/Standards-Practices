# Code Linting & Hinting

> As interpreted languages lack compile-time checks, errors during runtime can have a major affect on development and customization. Code linting is the practice of examining code files as they are modified, looking for common pitfalls and errors before code is executed. Linting can check to ensure not only that the code will not introduce common bugs or errors, but also for formatting and consistency issues.

## Tools

The following tools are recommended based on their associated language:

### JavaScript

The standard utility for code hinting is JSHint. The `.jshintrc` file in this directory sets up standard config parameters. For more information please see the [JSHint Website](http://www.jshint.com/).

### CSS

The standard utility for linting CSS is [CSSLint](http://csslint.net/)

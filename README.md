# One North Standards & Practices
This repository contains living documentation of One North Standards & Practices in the areas of modern web development, design and workflow.

While this does not specifically dictate exact processes, as each project should be evaluated and developed to meet the client needs, whenever possible the contained guides should be followed as closely as possible to ensure consistency across all projects.

## Strategy
The primary goal of the One North Standards & Practices is to establish a set of documents which outline our modern web development strategy. This includes overview of the technologies and practices in risk-mitigation format, a default set of tools, and accompanying resources.

This strategy begins by defining a list of **[Approved Technologies](/approved-tools.md)**

Establishing these areas of focus and presenting strategies and resources for each, and enforcing these policies, ensures that deliverables are of the highest quality possible. This strategy also promotes consistency in development, meaning that resources both internal and external can be moved more seamlessly between projects when needed without steep learning curves.

## Future Standards under review

In the coming weeks we will review and define the following resources to assist with development.

* [Version Control](/version-control) to maintain a clean and efficient workflow
* [Style Guide](/style-guide) for both JavaScript and CSS, ensuring common code formatting and readability
* [Documentation](/documentation) to provide vital information about code functionality and input/output
* [Linting](/linting) to provide code format and standards checking
* [Task Management](/task-management) to automate common tasks and processes
* [Dependency Management](/dependency-management) for tracking external, third-party dependencies
* [Continuous Integration](/continuos-integration) to monitor build throughout development
